## Base

### Description
This is the base part for the caster - made using OnShape, it's 200 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick, it has 7 holes, 6 six small (10mm), and 1 bigger (25mm).

### Reflection
I was surpried by how similar Onshape is to SolidWorks. Once you figure out where everything is, it's relatively simple to use, and it's pretty effective as well.


## Mount

### Description
This is the mount piece for the caster - it is 120 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick, and it shares 5 of the holes from the base, including 4 small and the larger one as well.

### Reflection
The mount for the caster was surprisingly easy - because you can make several parts in OnShape at the same time, you can base parts after each other. Since the holes on the mount line up with the holes on the base, it's possible to use the "Use" feature in order to copy the edges from the base. With that, though, you can't select the whole sketch when you are extruding, you have to select the potion of that sketch that you want, which is easy enough, since you just have to click on it.


## Fork

### Description
This assignment is for the fork of the caster which holds the wheel. It's based on a small cyclinder, 80 mm in diameter and 8 mm thick, with two "prongs" with fillets, 40 mm by 5 mm and 75 mm high, with a hole extruded through both prongs. The shaft of the fork is made up of two concentric circles, 15 and 20 mm, and 60 mm deep, with a chamfer on the edges.

### Reflection
This was, again, pretty easy - very similar to SolidWorks. The keyboard shortcuts are good; I suppose that's different from SolidWorks - most of them make sense as well, which is nice (c for circle, r for rectangle, etc.).


## Tire

### Description
This is the tire for the wheel of the caster. It is a revolve, not an extrude, and the basic shape is a symmetrical trapezoid, revolved, then filletted to round it out.

### Reflection
This was fairly simple - the revolve feature in OnShape is good, but I did notice that it doesn't have degrees of rotation like SolidWorks did. 


## Wheel

### Description
This is the wheel that goes with the tire for the caster. It starts as an oddly shaped combination of rectangles, which is revolved around a horizontal centre line to form a wheel shape with a wider edge and centre than the middle bit. Then, holes are extruded out of it and the edges filleted, then patterned circularly, to be finished with a fillet of the entirety of the faces on both sides of the wheel.

### Reflection
The trim feature does NOT have a power trim setting that I could find - it's honestly annoying to go around clicking all the little bits :unamused:. The circular feature pattern bit is fine; the fillet feature is good; I do think it's interesting that you can extrude a cut in Onshape rather than having to make a hole or whatever it was in SolidWorks - isn't that the opposite of what extrude means anyways?


## Axle and Collar

### Description
These are the axle and collar for the wheel of the caster. The axle is a hollow cylinder, with interior diameter 6 mm and exterior 10 mm, 60 mm deep symettric to the middle. It has a mirrored cutout for two flat parts at the ends. The collar is based on the geometry of the axle: the interior diameter is 10 mm and the exterior is 15mm. It has a 3 mm hole in it that goes through to the flat part on the end of the axle.

### Reflection
The "use" feature is very useful - it makes the whole process just that much faster because you don't have to make another shape the same as one you've already done. I love that you can make several parts at once as well in OnShape, it's really quite nice. The part studios for division is good too, so that you can make multiple parts in the same document, but not neccessarily all in the same space. It's really great that you can use the through all feature but still only apply it to one of the parts, as it makes removing through extrusion much easier.


## Bearing

### Description
This is a small bearing for the wheel of the caster - it actually shares the dimensions of the middle circular face of the wheel of the caster, so I sketched it in the same part studio as the wheel, just using the "use" feature for the dimensions, and extruding it 5 mm thick.

### Reflection
Again, the use feature makes this very simple - this was definitely the easiest part to make, because there was no real sketching involved at all.

## Washer

### Description
This is the final independent piece for the caster - the washer. It's just a very simple hollow cylinder, 20 mm interior diameter, 30 mm exterior diameter, 5mm thick.

### Reflection
This part was just super simple - I was able to do it very quickly. 
Overall, making all of these parts has shown me how similar to SolidWorks OnShape really is. Having used SolidWorks a lot last year, doing all of these little parts in OnShape has been pretty easy with the provided instructions, and honestly kind of fun. In general, I think OnShape is better set up than SolidWorks, and I never have to worry about losing my progress or trying to figure out how to get back to something after I've screwed up again (yay!).

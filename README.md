Work for Basic CAD canvas module

## Base part
![base for caster](images/part1_eng.png)
This is the base part for the caster. It has seven holes, six the same size (10mm) and made using linnear patterns, and the other attached to the origin (25mm). I was surpried by how similar Onshape is to SolidWorks once you figure out where everything is.

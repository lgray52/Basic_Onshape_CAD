## Base

### Description
This is the base part for the caster - made using OnShape, it's 200 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick, it has 7 holes, 6 six small (10mm), and 1 bigger (25mm).

### Reflection
I was surpried by how similar Onshape is to SolidWorks. Once you figure out where everything is, it's relatively simple to use, and it's pretty effective as well.


## Mount

### Description
This is the mount piece for the caster - it is 120 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick, and it shares 5 of the holes from the base, including 4 small and the larger one as well.

### Reflection
The mount for the caster was surprisingly easy - because you can make several parts in OnShape at the same time, you can base parts after each other. Since the holes on the mount line up with the holes on the base, it's possible to use the "Use" feature in order to copy the edges from the base. With that, though, you can't select the whole sketch when you are extruding, you have to select the potion of that sketch that you want, which is easy enough, since you just have to click on it.


## Fork

### Description
This assignment is for the fork of the caster which holds the wheel. It's based on a small cyclinder, 80 mm in diameter and 8 mm thick, with two "prongs" with fillets, 40 mm by 5 mm and 75 mm high, with a hole extruded through both prongs. The shaft of the fork is made up of two concentric circles, 15 and 20 mm, and 60 mm deep, with a chamfer on the edges.

### Reflection
This was, again, pretty easy - very similar to SolidWorks. The keyboard shortcuts are good; I suppose that's different from SolidWorks - most of them make sense as well, which is nice (c for circle, r for rectangle, etc.).


## Tire

### Description
This is the tire for the wheel of the caster. It is a revolve, not an extrude, and the basic shape is a symmetrical trapezoid, revolved, then filletted to round it out.

### Reflection
This was fairly simple - the revolve feature in OnShape is good, but I did notice that it doesn't have degrees of rotation like SolidWorks did. 


## Wheel

### Description
This is the wheel that goes with the tire for the caster. It starts as an oddly shaped combination of rectangles, which is revolved around a horizontal centre line to form a wheel shape with a wider edge and centre than the middle bit. Then, holes are extruded out of it and the edges filleted, then patterned circularly, to be finished with a fillet of the entirety of the faces on both sides of the wheel.

### Reflection
The trim feature does NOT have a power trim setting that I could find - it's honestly annoying to go around clicking all the little bits :unamused:. The circular feature pattern bit is fine; the fillet feature is good; I do think it's interesting that you can extrude a cut in Onshape rather than having to make a hole or whatever it was in SolidWorks - isn't that the opposite of what extrude means anyways?
